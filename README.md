# unsupervised-machine-learning

this repo has two main things:
1- unsupervised machine learning from scratch ---> contains pca and kmeans from scratch

2- final project ---> trying different unsupervised algorithms on the "Credit Card Dataset for Clustering" from kaggle

used algorithms: \n
1- kmeans and elbow method

2- DBScan

3- hierarichal clustering

4- T-SNE

5- Gaussian models (Expectation maximization)

6- isolated forest (for outlier detection)
