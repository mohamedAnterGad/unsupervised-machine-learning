# unsupervised-machine-learning

this repo has two main things:<br>

1- unsupervised machine learning from scratch ---> contains pca and kmeans from scratch
2- final project ---> trying different unsupervised algorithms on the "Credit Card Dataset for Clustering" from kaggle

used algorithms: <br>

1- kmeans and elbow method <br>
2- DBScan <br>
3- hierarichal clustering <br>
4- T-SNE <br>
5- Gaussian models (Expectation maximization) <br>
6- isolated forest (for outlier detection) <br>
